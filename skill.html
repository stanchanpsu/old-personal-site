<!----- THE INTRO -------->
<div id="intro">
	<h1>The Comunication Package</h1>
	<p>Just as there are many steps in the life cycle of a project such as conception, execution, and completion, there are many written documents that communicate a project. In a professional sense, a project cannot be more than one person's work if it isn't effectively communicated to other members of a team during the different stages of its life cycle. The following four documents in this portfolio showcase the skills that I have aquired in writing about a project from start to finish, each section outlining the specific attributes I contribute. Please find the full documents by clicking the titles.</p>

<!----- THE PROPOSAL ------>
	<div class="section white">
		<h2><a target="blank" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZH5c9qUmOrlRZPukNfV0aEk_sUcLXoQrjOGGlpqYEEs/edit?usp=sharing">The Proposal</a></h2>
		<blockquote>Research conducted in the fields of economics, psychology, and hospitality management have developed an understanding of motivational factors, customer tipping behavior, restaurant server perceptions, and the effect of delivery behavior on customers. The question of whether or not tipping at the time of placing an order or after an order has been placed will affect the speed of delivery has yet to be studied.</blockquote><br/>
		<p>Before a project can be pursued, a team member must first write a proposal. A proposal is a peice of writing that lets others know the intentions of a project and the reasons to support the project. When many departments are competing internally or externally for budget allocations, a well written proposal to effectively pitch an idea can greatly increase the chances of a project's approval.</p>
		<p>This proposal, that I coauthored, first comprehensively reviews the literature of money as an incentive, the history of food delivery and gratuity, and the perceptions of servers and customers in the food industry. Then, it outlines the need for a further study into the effects of certain tipping practices on food delivery speed.</p>
		<p>Through this proposal, I learned to work as part of a team to write a realistic professional report:</p><ul>
			<li>I used principles of framing and flow such as the "reverse pyramid scheme." This writing style first broadly explains to the reader background knowledge of the project. Then, the proposal is written to tailor the discussion to specifically address the project's goals and purpose.</li>
			<li>I also used principles of readability such as concise sectioning and formatting to improve the reader's reception of the proposal. A document is more easily read when it is laid out in a format that is meaningful and organized.</li></ul>
		<p>As part of a project team, I can draw from my experiences writing this and other proposals, making me the ideal candidate to write proposals for grants, financial packages, or approvals.  </p>

<!------ THE SPECIFICATION ----->
	
<!------ THE PRESENTATION ------>
	<div class="section">
		<h2><a target="blank" href="http://1drv.ms/1JKShLj">The Presentation</a></h2>
		<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" id="ted"  >
		<iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=6232D1477A3D96F1&resid=6232d1477a3d96f1%2132040&authkey=AL4OLcWypBSGkLU&em=2" scrolling="no"></iframe>
		</div>
		<p>Finally, for a project to be noticed it must be shared effectively. Whether I am sharing an idea, procedure, or prototype, I make presentations not only to last for the duration of a meeting, but to last indefinitely in an individual's mind.</p>
		<p>Arguably, the modern standard for high quality presentations is <a target="blank" href="ted.com">TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design)</a>. Soft Skills from Hard Hits in Karate is one TED style talk that I created to share my love of martial arts and the impact it had on me as a person.</p>
		<p>In this simple but powerful PowerPoint, I use many of the design principles that I have learned as an <a target="blank" href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/ambassadors/">engineering ambassador</a> and as a presentation enthusiast:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>High quality and large scale visuals accompanied by succinct but complete sentences extend the principles of <a target="blank" href ="http://www.writing.engr.psu.edu/slides.html">assertion-evidence</a> slide design.</li>
			<li>Performing this presentation, I engaged the audience with a captivating public speaking style providing them with context and relatability</li>
		</ul>
		<p> This presentation was not written about a technical subject, but it is only one example of the experiences I have had to share my ideas with an audience. Here, I've showcased my ability to present ideas as abstract as self-control, confidence, and perseverence. On a technical team, I will be able to use my experiences with this and other presentations to effectively and concretely communicate an engineering or research topic.
