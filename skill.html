<!----- THE INTRO -------->
<div id="intro" class="container-fluid">
	<div class="col-md-10">
	<h1>The Communication Package</h1>
	<p>Just as there are many steps in the life cycle of a project such as conception, execution, and completion, there are many written documents that communicate a project. In a professional sense, a project cannot be more than one person's work if it isn't effectively communicated to other members of a team during the different stages of its life cycle. The following four documents in this portfolio showcase the skills that I have acquired in writing about a project from start to finish, each section outlining the specific attributes I contribute. Please find the full documents by clicking the titles.</p>
	<p></p>
	</div>
</div>
	
<!----- THE PROPOSAL ------>
	<div class="section white container-fluid">
		<h2><a target="blank" href="http://1drv.ms/1GD5QvU">The Proposal</a></h2>
		<div class="col-md-10">
		<blockquote>Research conducted in the fields of economics, psychology, and hospitality management have developed an understanding of motivational factors, customer tipping behavior, restaurant server perceptions, and the effect of delivery behavior on customers. The question of whether or not tipping at the time of placing an order or after an order has been placed will affect the speed of delivery has yet to be studied.</blockquote><br/>
		<p>Before a project can be pursued, a team member must first write a proposal. A proposal is a piece of writing that lets others know the intentions of a project and the reasons to support the project. When departments are competing internally or externally for budget allocations, a well written proposal to effectively pitch an idea can greatly increase the chances of a project's approval.</p>
		<p>This proposal, that I coauthored, first comprehensively reviews the literature of money as an incentive, the history of food delivery and gratuity, and the perceptions of servers and customers in the food industry. Then, it outlines the need for a further study into the effects of certain tipping practices on food delivery speed.</p>
		<p>Through this proposal, I learned to work as part of a team to write a realistic professional report:</p><ul>
			<li>I used principles of framing and flow such as the "reverse pyramid scheme." This writing style first broadly explains to the reader background knowledge of the project. Then, the proposal is written to tailor the discussion to specifically address the project's goals and purpose.</li>
			<li>I also used principles of readability such as concise sectioning and formatting to improve the reader's reception of the proposal. A document is more easily read when it is laid out in a format that is meaningful and organized.</li></ul>
		<p>As part of a project team, I can draw from my experiences writing this and other proposals, making me the ideal candidate to write proposals for grants, financial packages, or approvals.</p>

<!------ THE CRITIQUE ---->
<div class="section container-fluid">
	<h2><a target="blank" href="http://1drv.ms/1DUJ1Qe">The Critique</a></h2>
	<div class="col-md-6">
		<blockquote class="whitequote">This email is in regards to your recently posted YouTube video: Gordon Ramsey New Beef Wellington. After watching the video, I have composed a list of the strengths and weaknesses of your instruction set. Please review the changes I recommend below, for your video, to further improve your audienceâ€™s understanding of how to make a Beef Wellington.</blockquote><br/>
		<p>As execution of a project progresses and ideas are exchanged, formal revisions of raw ideas by each team member is crucial. Critiques must be used to professionally give constructive feedback in the best interest of the project. </p>
		<p>The purpose of this critique to Chef Ramsey is two-fold:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>This critique follows a highly professional email format that is able to provide critical information and also establish goodwill between teammates.</li>
			<li>The content of this critique dives into the intricacies of defining a well written instruction set as I write about the strengths and weakness of Chef Ramsey's ability to explain how to make a Beef Wellington.</li>
		</ol>
		<p>Through writing this critique, I have learned to write crucial and mature feedback. I also refined my understanding of helpful and clear instruction sets which are often an important part of team projects. During execution of a real project, I can be trusted to always refine ideas to better the project and company, while also retaining a good relationship with my teammates.</p>

<!------ THE SPECIFICATION ----->

<div class="section white container-fluid">
	<h2><a target="blank" href="http://1drv.ms/1GFuFdp">The Specification</a></h2>
	<div class="col-md-10">
	<blockquote>Unlike the simple tortilla wrap, our annealed Mexican food hand protector improves upon conventional corn wrap technology by providing a hard but flexible pincher-like glove to allow you to easily get the job done. Simply grasp your hand around the outside of the patented Hard Taco Shell and pinch gently to pick up an item. Never again get your hands dirty when picking up things like clothes, utensils, beauty products, and much more.</blockquote><br/>
	<p>When a project is finished and ready to be pushed to market, it needs to be promoted properly. Technical products intended for a specific technical user base require a specification (spec) sheet. Spec sheets promote the product, garnering trust and interest from potential buyers. Along with promoting the product, spec sheets also provide relevant specifications for the user to properly use the product.</p>
	<p>In this satirical spec sheet, I reimagine the common hard taco shell as a more technical product - a hand protector. Through this writing assignment, I have learned to document technical information effectively and refined my ability to visually represent my projects.</p>
	<p>Although this spec sheet isn't for a "serious" product, it contains many of the parts of a real technical documentation:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>The background information correctly argues for the product to be a viable solution for a specific application.</li>
		<li>The specification table provides only relevant information to objectively explain the limits and applications of the product.</li>
		<li>The figure follows conventions of professional illustration with proper captioning and callouts.</li>
	</ul>
	<p>Whether a project is a research study asking for peer approval, an actual product competing for market share, or an idea vying for support, it must be sold in some sense. Drawing from principles of this spec sheet, I can properly create technical documentation for any project.</p>

<!------ THE PRESENTATION ------>
	<div class="section container-fluid">
		<h2><a target="blank" href="http://1drv.ms/1JKShLj">The Presentation</a></h2>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-16by9" id="ted" >
		<iframe src="https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=6232D1477A3D96F1&resid=6232d1477a3d96f1%2132040&authkey=AL4OLcWypBSGkLU&em=2" scrolling="no"></iframe>
		</div>
		</div>
		<div class="col-md-6">
		<p>Finally, for a project to be noticed it must be shared effectively. Whether I am sharing an idea, procedure, or prototype, I make presentations not only to last for the duration of a meeting, but to last indefinitely in an individual's mind.</p>
		<p>Arguably, the modern standard for high quality presentations is <a target="blank" href="http://www.ted.com">TED (Technology, Entertainment and Design)</a>. Soft Skills from Hard Hits in Karate is one TED style talk that I created to share my love of martial arts and the impact it had on me as a person.</p>
		<p>In this simple but powerful PowerPoint, I use many of the design principles that I have learned as an <a target="blank" href="http://www.engr.psu.edu/ambassadors/">engineering ambassador</a> and as a presentation enthusiast:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>High quality and large scale visuals accompanied by succinct but complete sentences extend the principles of <a target="blank" href ="http://www.writing.engr.psu.edu/slides.html">assertion-evidence</a> slide design.</li>
			<li>Performing this presentation, I engaged the audience with a captivating public speaking style providing them with context and relatability.</li>
		</ul>
		<p> This presentation was not written about a technical subject, but it is only one example of the experiences I have had to share my ideas with an audience. Here, I've showcased my ability to present ideas as abstract as self-control, confidence, and perseverance. On a technical team, I will be able to use my experiences with this and other presentations to effectively and concretely communicate an engineering or research topic.

	<hr/>
	<p>The preceding were only a handful of examples of the numerous writing and presentation skills I can contribute to any professional team. Every industry needs a communicator, but unfortunately, not every engineer is a communicator.</p>
	<p>I strive to be more than the average engineer and can be that communicator.</p><br/>
